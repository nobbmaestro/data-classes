# Module 1 - String manipulation and formatting

This is something you do frequently in the real world. Things like input validation, sanitization, conversion or internationalization are common practice.

## Project  - Case Converter

In programming, there are five common cases: camelCase, snakecase, kebab-case, PascalCase and UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE. For this project, you are to Write a function that takes in a sentence and a desired case as the inputs, and then converts the sentence into the desired case.

### Examples:
> convert("Hello, World.", "camel")
> Output: helloWorld

> convert("Hello, World.", "snake")
> Output: hello_world

> convert("Hello, World.", "kebab")
> Output: hello-world

> convert("Hello, World.", "pascal")
> Output: HelloWorld

> convert("Hello, World.", "uppercasesnake")
> Output: HELLO_WORLD
